# dump_unenc_keys (Windows)
Dumps private keys from unencrypted wallet.dat files using the "0201010420" private key marker

Searches through a given file looking for the "0201010420" byte marker, then extracts the next 32 bytes. Converts the hex to both Compressed and Uncompressed WIFs and dumps to STDOUT (along with matching address to making searching easier)

This script can NOT be used with wallet.dat's that have been encrypted.

Put your wallet.dat in the same directory and execute:
./dump_unenc_keys_windows_cli wallet.dat
